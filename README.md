# Morpheus Translation Script Generator

Try it here [https://spoonboy.io/translation-script-generator/](https://spoonboy.io/translation-script-generator/)

Simple website form which allows the user to paste in their JSON payload, which is parsed for object keys values
such that the user can pick which keys they wish to use to represent `name` and `value` in their translation script.

A filter can optionally also be set, to determine which data is presented in the results and the complete JavaScript 
translation can be generated at the touch of a button ready for use with a morpheus option list which uses that JSON data source.
